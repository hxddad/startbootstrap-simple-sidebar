                    <p>If you are reading this and starting or completing your first year of Software Engineering, welcome aboard!
                        Your first year will contain general and core courses that are common across all engineering programs. 
                        The only difference though is that <strong>Software, Computer and Electrical Engineers</strong> have to take <strong>EECS 1028 
                        (Discrete Mathematics for Engineers)</strong>, the rest <strong>(Mechanical, Civil and Space)</strong> will have to take
                        <strong>ESSE 1012 (The Earth Environment)</strong> in their first year.
                    </p>

                    <h3>ENG 1101 - Ethics, Communication & Problem Solving</h3>
                    <p>
                        This will be your first ever ENG course, which will cover engineering ethics and case studies, communication and problem solving. Straightforward course, 
                        but quite time-consuming. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Difficulty: 2/10.  
                    </p>

                    <h3>EECS 1011 - Computational Thinking Through Mechatronics (MATLAB)</h3>
                    <p>
                        This will be your very first programming class in your undergraduate studies,
                        with a programming language used by scientists and engineers called 
                        MATLAB (short for Matrix Laboratory). This course also assumes you never programmed before. You may be asked
                        to buy an Arduino Uno kit for the final project you'll be assigned
                        at the end of the course. I personally have never used MATLAB after
                        I finished this course. Despite that, if you've never coded before,
                        I would advise you to learn the coding fundamentals (variables, scoping,
                        loops, etc.) for future courses. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Difficulty: 2/10 if known at least one programming language, otherwise 4/10.                    
                    </p>
