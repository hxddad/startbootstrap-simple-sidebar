                    <p>If you are reading this and starting or completing your first year of Software Engineering, welcome aboard!
                        Your first year will contain classic and core engineering courses that are common across all engineering programs. 
                        The only difference though is that <strong>Software, Computer and Electrical Engineers</strong> have to take <strong>EECS 1028 
                        (Discrete Mathematics for Engineers)</strong>, the rest <strong>(Mechanical, Civil and Space)</strong> will have to take
                        <strong>ESSE 1012 (The Earth Environment)</strong> in their first year.
                    </p>

                    <h3>ENG 1101 - Ethics, Communication & Problem Solving</h3>
                    <p>
                        This will be your first ever ENG course, which will cover engineering ethics and case studies, communication and problem solving. Straightforward course, 
                        but quite time-consuming. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Difficulty: 2/10.  
                    </p>

                    <h3>EECS 1011 - Computational Thinking Through Mechatronics (MATLAB)</h3>
                    <p>
                        This will be your very first programming class in your undergraduate studies,
                        with a programming language used by scientists and engineers called 
                        MATLAB (short for Matrix Laboratory). This course also assumes you never programmed before. You may be asked
                        to buy an Arduino Uno kit for the final project you'll be assigned
                        at the end of the course. I personally have never used MATLAB after
                        I finished this course. Despite that, if you've never coded before,
                        I would advise you to learn the coding fundamentals (variables, scoping,
                        loops, etc.) for future courses. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Difficulty: 2/10 if known at least one programming language, otherwise 4/10.                    
                    </p>

                    <h3>MATH 1013 - Applied Calculus 1</h3>
                    <p>
                        Behold your very first calculus course at university. This course
                        touches on differential calculus, which is basically everything you 
                        learned in calculus in high school in Ontario, with a few new topics
                        and concepts you'll have to learn (including a little bit on 
                        integrals in MATH1014). If you've taken AP or IB calculus, the course
                        shouldn't be difficult.

                    <h3>MATH 1025 - Applied Linear Algebra</h3>
                    <p>
                        This will be your very first programming class in your undergraduate studies,
                        with a programming language used by scientists and engineers called 
                        MATLAB (short for Matrix Laboratory). This course also assumes you never programmed before. You may be asked

                    <h3>PHYS 1800 - Engineering Mechanics</h3>
                    <p>
                        This first physics course you will be taking will mostly be
                        review from grade 11 and 12 physics, since it mostly covers mechanics
                        (kinematics, force, energy, etc.). You will also have a laboratory
                        component where you will work on experiments related to course content
                        that are worth your grade. Keep practicing physics problems and treat
                        labs as free marks to get a decent grade.   
                        <br/><br/>
                        Difficulty: 6/10.

                    <h3>ENG 1102 - Engineering Design Principles</h3>
                    <p>
                        This first physics course you will be taking will mostly be
                        review from grade 11 and 12 physics, since it mostly covers mechanics
                        (kinematics, force, energy, etc.). You will also have a laboratory

                    <h3>CHEM 1100 - Chemistry & Materials Science</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is your first (and probably last) chemistry course in
                        the program. I mostly found this course to be easier than my grade
                        12 chemistry class, part of it due to having no organic chemistry.
                        This course requires practice and memorization to do well.
                        You also will do chemistry lab experiments that account for your grades.
                        The nice thing about this course is that you can take it anytime, since
                        it's not a prerequisite to any mandatory future courses. If you are 
                        looking to do a lighter course load in your second semester of your
                        first year, CHEM 1100 is your pick to opt out for now. 
                        Generally, your 2nd semester is harder than the 1st, because of new content that
                        you have never learned in high school, which will be common in 2nd year
                        and beyond. Though, it would be nice to get over it soon as you can, since
                        it may not be offered every semester or you forget most of your chemistry
                        from high school.   
                        <br/><br/>

                    </p>

                    <h3>EECS 1021 - OOP from Sensors to Actuators (Java)</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is the same premise as EECS 1011, but you will be learning and
                        using the Java programming language along with OOP 
                        (Object Oriented Programming) principles. I cannot stress this 
                        enough, but take this course religiously. Know the Java 
                        syntax and OOP well, it will come in handy for future programming and EECS
                        courses. This course also helped me build my first personal project
                        using the Arduino board and with several Java libraries. Java may be
                        a bit difficult to get used to coming from only knowing MATLAB or
                        a dynamically typed language like Python. I had a 
                        Python background, so I had to get used to Java's syntax and 
                        features.      
                        <br/><br/>
                        Difficulty: 4/10.                    
                    </p>

                    <h3>MATH 1014 - Applied Calculus 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is the hardest calculus (but the most interesting in my
                        opinion) course you will take in your undergrad. You will expand
                        through integral calculus with integration techniques, improper
                        integrals, sequences and series and power series. Practice problems
                        and master course concepts to do well, as you did previously in 
                        math1013 for a decent grade.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Difficulty: 7/10.                    
                    </p>

                    <h3>PHYS 1801 - Electricity, Magnetism and Optics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Just as the course title says, you will learning about these things.
                        This is the most crucial physics course (and an interesting one) for
                        future courses such as electrical circuits, digital logic design, etc.
                        You will also be mostly using the breadboard with software
                        such as LabVIEW in the labs. I never used a breadboard prior to this course,
                        so it was a bit tricky for me to use it. Ask your TAs for help
                        if your breadboard isn't working the way it's supposed to after
                        tinkering with it for a while, so you don't burn time during your lab.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Difficulty: 6/10.                    
                    </p>

                    <h3>EECS 1028 - Discrete Mathematics for Engineers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Let me introduce you to the most infamous course to every first
                        year EECS engineering student. The primary reason this is difficult
                        is because it's different from the computational or plug-n-chug
                        courses you've been doing previously. It is about proofs, which
                        most students struggle with at first. Try to get a decent professor, work
                        with a group of friends, understand the concepts 
                        and practice, practice, practice to succeed. Ideally, try to get this course
                        done before you start your 2nd year. I dropped it in my 2nd semester in first year,
                        but then I retook it with a different professor in the summer and got a decent grade, 
                        without tanking my EECS GPA. It's also
                        a crucial course that requires you to write proofs and know logic
                        for useful courses like EECS 2101 (Data Structures). Another reason 
                        why it's hard because you may be required to learn exclusive concepts
                        taught from course notes and unavailable online to self-learn. I
                        however took the course in the summer where we used a regular
                        published discrete mathematics textbook, instead of foreign
                        course notes.
